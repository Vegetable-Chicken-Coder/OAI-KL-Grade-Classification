### Under construction

This repo consists of three parts. To reproduce the entire experiments, you will need to
1. Train a detector and use the detector to annotate all OAI dataset. See documentation in `./oai-knee-detection`
2. Do the preprocessing for all OAI dataset by following `./preprocessing`
